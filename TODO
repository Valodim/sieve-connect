Things that sieve-connect would like for xmas.

 * A full test-suite to torture the client.
 * Support for referrals
   * A server which does this so it can be tested
 * Figuring out sensible things to do with response codes in general
 * Figuring out what's going on with the isode implementation and the Perl
   SASL libraries that breaks authentication.
 * A UTF-8 server, so I can add tests for the UTF-8 filenames and figure out
   what should be done to support this cleanly with minimal pain.  Adding
   untestable support is not a path I wish to explore.
   * Note that the protocol itself is pretty much US-ASCII with an exception
     that script filenames can be in UTF-8; but then literal quoted strings
     (length prefix) count in octets and there's no character set restriction
     upon those.
 * Full SASLprep support (*sob*).
 * Understand quotas.
 * Use HAVESPACE automatically.
 * Check server reporting of script errors in PUTSCRIPT.
 * Support for RENAME extension.
 * Proper support for the new NOOP extension.  :)
 * Support for sieve:// URLs, both for specifying server (and for referrals).
   * sieve:// URL specifying script-name on cmdline should by default download
     and emit to stdout, unless it's the second parameter and the first is a
     local file
 * Time to pick through RFC 5804 in detail and find what else we're missing.


Things we got because Santa is generous:

 * a published specifcation!  RFC 5804.
 * NOOP, to help clients work around the ambiguity in whether servers do or
   don't send a capability response automatically, which broke the lockstep
   model of the protocol.
