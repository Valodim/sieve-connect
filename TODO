Things that sieve-connect would like for xmas.

 * A final published specification to work against
   * A noop command would be good, to help clients work around the ambiguity
     in whether servers do or don't send a capability response automatically;
     this breaks the lockstep model and would require an event-driven engine
     to work around, which is too much for a client designed to be small and
     simple.  We hack around it by sending NOOP and expecting a NO response.
 * A full test-suite to torture the client.
 * Support for referrals
   * A server which does this so it can be tested
 * Figuring out sensible things to do with response codes in general
 * Figuring out what's going on with the isode implementation and the Perl
   SASL libraries that breaks authentication.
 * A UTF-8 server, so I can add tests for the UTF-8 filenames and figure out
   what should be done to support this cleanly with minimal pain.  Adding
   untestable support is not a path I wish to explore.
   * Note that the protocol itself is pretty much US-ASCII with an exception
     that script filenames can be in UTF-8; but then literal quoted strings
     (length prefix) count in octets and there's no character set restriction
     upon those.
